This was a second iteration for a project done on Air Traffic Control. The goal of this project was to determine if algorithms could be effectively applied to airport traffic control, specifically landing, taking off, and taxiing to the correct terminal. To see code annotations submitted with the project, see [annotations.ipynb](https://github.com/VR314/ATCSharp/blob/master/ATCSharp_SimSharp/annotations.ipynb).
