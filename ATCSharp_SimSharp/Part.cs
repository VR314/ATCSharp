/* Vision:
 *  - each runway has a corresponding parallel runway
 *  - each runway/parallel complex is connected to the main Gate/TW complex via a connecting taxiway
 *  - each Part has a +/- direction, indicating towards/away from the GTW complex, each Part has a Tuple of Parts it's connected to, depending on the direction
 *      - decision-making, get a tree of each Part's connecteds in the direction you want (UP TO A CERTAIN DEPTH)
 *      - implement time-blocking queue
 *  - assign free gate at landing => eventually change this to plane 'types' (representing airlines or plane size) that can only go to certain gates, and pick the gate only when within scope of the GTW complex
 *  - when done GTW processing, pick a random runway and begin taxiing (how to prevent conflicts when planes are far away)
 *      - REFINE PRINCIPLES OF DECENTRALIZATION / GOALS / ALGORITHMS
 *  - checking when there is a traffic jam!
